Chronological breakdown and key takeaways from my two academic and one vocational education.

## Cand.Merc. Business Administration & Leadership
### From 2022 to 2024
- **Topics included:**

 Change Management, Advanced Finance, Data design and modelling, various projects in close collaborations with marketing bureau, mobility provider
- **Favourite subject:**

The one i Enjoyed the most was definetely the quantitative subjet on Data Design where I learned more about coding and statistical methods and develloped a data model displaying relations between crime in Europe and surprising correlated factors.
- **GPA:** 

My final grade average was a Danish 9 meaning my GPA was 3.6 out of 4.

- **Thesis:**

I wrote my thesis on strategies for M&A for coorporative companies using Norlys' acquisition of Telia as a case study. I got precious access to key executives in Norlys and extensive knowledge of the infrastructure needed for _Connectivity_ from industry experts, and conducted a detailed market analysis and financial analysis.

- **I learned:**

 Much about utilizing data to meet commercial needs and to discover new bottlenecks and business opportunities. My thesis taught me much about executive leadership, and equity constraints for financing strategic investments. I also gained extensive project management experience as every semester consisted of new group projects where I gained leadership and communication experience.

## BSc. International Business & Politics
### From 2018 to 2021
- **Topics included:**

Micro- and Macro Economics, Political Science and Political Economy, Corporate Finance
- **Favourite subject:**

My favourite subject was _Political and Economic Thought_ which was taught by the excellent Eddie Ashbee. His persuasive teaching and analysis was very formative.

- **Bachelor Project:**

With a parther I wrote the major project on Social Movements and their political and marketing implications. We compared different itterations or waves of _Black Lives Matter_ with different waves of _Me Too_ and measured their scope and impact. Truly interesting intersection between sociology, politics and commerce.
- **GPA:**

My danish average grade for the degree was 7.6 meaning my GPA was 3.2

- I learned much about Economics, Politics and Markets; and how they interplay within industries and society at large. The interconnectivity of seemingly varied fields I found extremely interesting.

## Adv. Diploma - Leadership & Ministry - Sydney, Australia
### From 2015 to 2018
- **Topics included:**

Public Speaking, OT Studies, NT Studies, Marriage and Family, Leading and Building Teams, Leading Departmens and Leading Organisations.
- **Favourite subject:**

My favourite subject was probably _Intro to New Testament_ which was excellently taught by Duncan Corby and truly mind blowing. I also loved the aspect of the degree which was vocational and required actual experience leading teams and departments in order to get credits. 

- **I learned:**

 so so much about leading volunteers with no other incentive than desire to grow and to give. While serving in Bondi I built a team which I then empowered and encouraged to step into leadership roles and build their own teams. In a matter of months we went from having no organisation serving the young adults of our congregation to having 4 teams of dedicated leaders all reaching out and making a difference. That's how I reased and led leaders which was a great joy I look back on with pride.
 And living in Sydney is something I can strongly recommend to everyone who gets the opportunity!
